### Installation

To begin using **@bshg/validation** in your project, install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @bshg/validation
```

or

```bash
yarn add @bshg/validation
```

### Scenario

You're building a registration form for a new app that collects the following data: username, password, confirmPassword, full name, age, email, and phone number. To ensure data integrity and security, you need to validate each field according to specific rules before submitting the form data.

Here are the validation requirements for each field:

- **Username**: Must be provided and contain only alphanumeric characters.
- **Password**: Required, with a minimum length of 8 characters.
- **Confirm Password**: Must match the value of the password field.
- **Full Name**: Required and should contain only alphabetic characters and spaces.
- **Age**: Must be a positive number.
- **Email**: Must be a valid email address and is required.
- **Phone**: Must be a valid phone number and is required.

### Implementation

First, we need to create our `User` type:

```typescript
type User = {
    username: string
    password: string
    confirmPassword: string
    fullName: string
    age: number
    email: string
    phone: string
}
```

Next, let's create the validator for the `User` type.

Firstly, import `v` from the `@bshg/validation` package:

```typescript
import { v } from '@bshg/validation';
```

Then, let's create our validator and assign it to a variable for later use:

```typescript
const userValidator = v.validator<User>({
    items: {
        username: v.string().required().alphanumeric(), // required and should contain only alphanumeric characters
        password: v.string().required().min(8), // required and should be at least 8 characters long 
        confirmPassword: v.string().required(), // required
        fullName: v.string().required().matches(/^[a-zA-Z\s]*$/), // required and should contain only alphabetic characters and spaces
        age: v.number().positive(), // should be a positive number 
        email: v.string().required().email(), // required and should be a valid email address
        phone: v.string().required().phone(), // required and should be a valid phone number 
    }
});
```

For the `confirmPassword` field, we need to ensure it matches the `password` field. We can use the `onError()` method to add a custom validation rule:

```typescript
confirmPassword: v.string().required().onError<User>({
    error: (val, obj) => val !== obj.password, // check if passwords match
    message: 'Passwords do not match' // error message
})
```

Alternatively, we can use the built-in `as<Type>(key)` method to compare the value with another field in the same object:

```typescript
confirmPassword: v.string().required().as<User>('password', { message: 'Passwords do not match' })
```

Now, after defining our validator, we can use it in our code:

```typescript
const user: User = {
    username: 'bsh.g',
    password: 'password',
    confirmPassword: 'pass',
    fullName: 'Bousalih Hamza',
    email: 'example@ex.com',
    phone: '1234567890',
    age: 20
}

const result = userValidator.validateInfo(user);
```

In this example, we're assuming that we have the object ready and we need to validate it.

Here is the result of the validation:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "results": {
    "items": [
      {
        "field": "username",
        "message": "Must contain only alphabetic characters",
        "valid": false,
        "value": "bsh.g"
      },
      {
        "field": "confirmPassword",
        "message": "Passwords do not match",
        "valid": false,
        "value": "pass"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The result will give you detailed information about why the validation failed.

### Validating Form Data in Real-Time

To validate data as it changes, such as when a user types into a form, you can use the validator directly within event handlers:

```jsx
<input type="text" name="username"
       onChange={() => userValidator.items?.username?.validate()}/>
{userValidator.items?.username?.valid === false &&
    <small>{userValidator.items?.username?.message}</small> <!-- display error message  -->
}
```

In this example we use .validate() to validate the `username` field when the user types into the input field.
and `.valid` and `.message` to get the validation status and error message.

:::note
Access the item status using `userValidator.items?.<field>?.<prop>`, where `prop` is a property of the `ValidatorItem` like `.validate()`, `.valid`, or `.message`.
