# Services Overview

By creating an instance of `BshEngine`, you gain access to a comprehensive suite of services designed to interact seamlessly with your BSH Engine instance.
Each service enables you to perform specific operations - such as authentication, entity management, user administration and more - through clear and intuitive SDK methods.

```typescript
const bshEngine = new BshEngine({
  host: 'https://your-instance.com'
})
```
