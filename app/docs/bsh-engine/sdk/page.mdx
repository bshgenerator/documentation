# BSH Engine SDK

<Callout type='info'>
    The BSH Engine SDK is currently under active development and will be released soon. Stay tuned for upcoming updates and further documentation!
</Callout>

The **BSH Engine SDK** is designed to make integrating your applications with the BSH Engine API fast, robust, and effortless. Instead of writing boilerplate code to connect, authenticate, and manage requests to the BSH Engine, the SDK provides libraries with ready-to-use methods covering all endpoints and features exposed by the API.

With the BSH Engine SDK, developers can:
- Seamlessly integrate all BSH Engine API features using simple, intuitive library calls.
- Save development time by relying on well-tested, maintained libraries that provide out-of-the-box support for all API capabilities.
- Focus on building your business logic while the SDK handles communication, authentication, error handling, and more.

Full documentation, usage examples, and supported languages will be made available upon release.
