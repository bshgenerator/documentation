# Interceptors Overview

Interceptors allow you to modify requests and responses, or handle errors globally. They are executed in the order they are added.

There are three types of interceptors:

1. **Pre-Interceptors**: Modify requests before they're sent
2. **Post-Interceptors**: Modify responses after they're received
3. **Error Interceptors**: Handle errors globally

Interceptors are useful for:
- Adding custom headers to all requests
- Logging requests and responses
- Transforming data
- Centralized error handling
- ...
