# Triggers

The **Triggers** feature in Bsh Engine enables you to automatically respond to changes in your application's data and entities. With this system, you can configure actions that are executed when specific events occur, such as the **_creation_**, **_update_**, or **_deletion_** of records.<br/>
Triggers provide a flexible way to enforce business logic, automate workflows, or integrate with external services without manual intervention.

Key capabilities of the trigger system include:

- **Event-driven automation**: Run custom logic in response to data changes or user actions.
- **Fine-grained control**: Specify which entities to watch, and define precisely when your trigger should fire.
- **Custom actions**: Execute built-in functions, run your own scripts, or call webhooks and APIs as part of your trigger's response.
- **Extensibility**: Chain multiple triggers and perform conditional checks.
- ...

Whether you're implementing audit trails, sending notifications, cleaning up related data, or enforcing validation rules, the Bsh Engine Triggers system provides a comprehensive toolbox for automating and extending your application's behavior.
