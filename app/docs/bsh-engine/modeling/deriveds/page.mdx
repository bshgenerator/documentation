# Derived Entities

<Callout>
    **Derived Entities** are a planned feature and are **not yet implemented** in the Bsh Engine.
</Callout>

**Derived Entities** will allow you to define entities whose data is derived from other entities, rather than being directly accessed in a database table or view.

They are intended to act as a dynamic layerâ€”behaving like regular entities within your application, but behind the scenes, combining or transforming data from existing entities according to your configuration. Unlike database views, virtual entities will exist solely within the Bsh Engine, offering a flexible way to create custom, computed, or aggregated data models without changing your actual database schema.

Stay tuned for updates as this feature is developed!
