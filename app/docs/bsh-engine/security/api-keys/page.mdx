API Keys will soon give you powerful control over API access and security for your application.

## What You'll Be Able to Do with API Keys

- **Authentication**: Generate and distribute unique API keys to grant access to external apps or developers.
- **Access Control**: Assign permissions or restrictions to each API key, specifying which endpoints and actions are allowed.
- **Key Management**: List, track, regenerate, and revoke API keys at any time.
- **Usage Monitoring**: View usage statistics and audit logs related to each API key.
- **Security**: Quickly disable compromised or expired keys without affecting other integrations.
