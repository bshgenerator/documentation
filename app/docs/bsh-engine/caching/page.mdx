# Caching

<Callout>
  **Caching** is a planned feature and is **not yet implemented** in the Bsh Engine.
</Callout>

The upcoming **Caching** system will enable the Bsh Engine to store frequently accessed data in memory, significantly reducing database load and speeding up response times for your application.

### What Caching Will Enable

- **Improved Performance:** Reduce the number of database queries by serving data from a fast, in-memory cache.
- **Scalability:** Handle more user requests efficiently by minimizing redundant data fetching.
- **Configurable Strategies:** Choose what data gets cached and define eviction policies that suit your application's needs.

> More details, configuration examples, and best practices will be added as development progresses. Stay tuned for updates!
