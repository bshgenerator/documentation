**Packaging** will enable you to bundle your entire application—including configurations and data—into a single, portable package. This feature is designed to simplify deployment, migration, backup, and sharing of your application.

### What Packaging Will Offer

- **Seamless Migration:** Easily move your application to new environments without manual reconfiguration.
- **Effortless Backups:** Create complete snapshots of your application's data and configurations for safekeeping.
- **Quick Restores:** Restore your application from a backup package in case of data loss or corruption.
- **Easy Sharing:** Distribute your fully-configured application package to others or across teams.
- **Simplified Deployment:** Deploy packaged applications with minimal setup, ensuring consistency across different environments.

> *Note: More details and usage instructions will be provided as development progresses.*

Stay tuned for updates as this feature is actively developed!
