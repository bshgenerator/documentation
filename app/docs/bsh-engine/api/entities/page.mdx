## Security

All Entities API endpoints are secured by the [authentication](/docs/bsh-engine/api/authentication) system. In addition, each entity operation is governed by specific [entity permissions](/docs/bsh-engine/modeling/entities#entity-permissions), ensuring users can only perform actions for which they have explicit authorization. Unauthorized requests will be denied accordingly.
