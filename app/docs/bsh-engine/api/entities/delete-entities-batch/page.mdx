# Batch Delete Entities

The **Batch Delete Entities** endpoint allows you to delete multiple records from a specific entity in a single API call, based on flexible search criteria. The request body uses the [BSH Search](/docs/bsh-engine/search) object to specify which records to remove.

```bash
DELETE /api/entities/:entityName/batch
```

## Request Body

```json
{
  "entity": "users",
  "query": [
    {
      "field": "name",
      "operator": "ilike",
      "value": "john"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `entity` | string | yes | The name of the entity to delete records from. |
| `query` | array | no | An array of conditions that match the records you want to delete. Supports all BSH query operators. |

<Callout type='error'>
  If no query is provided, the endpoint will delete all records from the entity.
</Callout>

## Response

A successful response returns an object indicating how many records were deleted:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "effected": 1
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "code": 200,
  "status": "OK",
  "meta": {}
}
```

<Callout type='info'>
  The <code>effected</code> property in the response indicates how many records matched the query and were deleted.
</Callout>

<Callout type='important'>
  This endpoint only processes the <code>entity</code> and <code>query</code> properties from the [BSH Search](/docs/bsh-engine/search) object. Any other properties will be ignored.
</Callout>
