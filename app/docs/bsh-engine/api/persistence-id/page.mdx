# Persistence ID

A **Persistence ID** is a unique and stable identifier assigned to each entity in the system. It serves as a consistent reference that allows you to retrieve, update, or interact with a specific entity—independent of its internal structure or database key configuration.

By abstracting away underlying database keys, the `persistenceId` ensures entities can be referenced across different parts of the application and through APIs.

## Single Primary Key

For entities with a **single primary key**, the `persistenceId` is identical to that key’s value.

**Example:**  
If an entity’s primary key is `id = 42`, then: `persistenceId = "42"`

## Multiple Primary Keys

For entities with **composite (multiple) primary keys**, the `persistenceId` is a [Base64](https://www.base64decode.org/)–encoded JSON string representing the key–value pairs.

**Example:**

- **Original JSON:**
  ```json
  {"pk1": "value1", "pk2": "value2"}
  ```

- **Base64 encoded:**

  For most entities, the `persistenceId` is the same as the primary key value.

  For entities with composite keys, always use the Base64-encoded JSON format described above.
