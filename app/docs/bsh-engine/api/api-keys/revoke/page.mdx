title: Revoke API Key
---

# Revoke API Key

Immediately invalidate an API key, preventing any further use. This action cannot be undone.

```bash
DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}
```

## Authentication

This endpoint requires a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | number | yes | The unique identifier of the API key to revoke |

## Response

**Success Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "API key revoked successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "My API Key",
      "apiKey": "bsh_********",
      "type": "MACHINE",
      "status": "REVOKED",
      "duration": 30,
      "startedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2025-02-14T10:30:00Z",
      "userId": "user-123"
    }
  ]
}
```

After revocation, the API key's `status` will be set to `REVOKED`, and it will no longer be accepted for authentication.

## Error Responses

**403 Forbidden** - Not authorized to revoke this key:

```json
{
  "code": 403,
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "meta": {
    "type": "Authorization Error",
    "details": "You are not authorized to revoke this API key"
  }
}
```

**404 Not Found** - Key not found:

```json
{
  "code": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "meta": {
    "type": "API Key Not Found",
    "details": "API key with id 123 does not exist"
  }
}
```

**401 Unauthorized** - Authentication required:

```json
{
  "code": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "meta": {
    "type": "Authentication Required"
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- Revoking an API key is **permanent** and **cannot be undone**
- Once revoked, the key will immediately stop working for all API requests
- You can only revoke API keys that belong to your user account
- Revoked keys will show `status: "REVOKED"` in subsequent list/search operations
- If you need to use the API again, you must create a new API key

## When to Revoke Keys

Consider revoking API keys in these scenarios:

- **Security breach**: If a key may have been compromised
- **Key rotation**: When rotating to a new key as part of security best practices
- **Project completion**: When an integration or project is no longer active
- **Access change**: When permissions need to be changed (create a new key with updated scopes instead)
- **Unused keys**: To clean up keys that are no longer needed
